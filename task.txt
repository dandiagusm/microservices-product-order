Each Microservice has its own Redis instance

Pros:
Isolation: One service crashing or misusing Redis (e.g., large keys) doesnâ€™t affect others.
Independent scaling: Each service can scale Redis based on its workload.
Independent caching strategy: Different TTLs, eviction policies, or data models per service.
Easier ownership and maintenance: Each team/service can manage its own Redis without coordination.

Cons:
Data duplication: If multiple services cache the same data, you may store duplicates.
Slightly higher operational overhead: More Redis instances to manage.
